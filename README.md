# dozenalconverterpython
A simple python program that takes an interger in decimal and outputs it in dozenal (stored as a string to account for the two extra characters, in this case represented as X and E). 

Just for fun, an example of a possible far worse implementation of this including no loops (and other bad decisions) has been included. It works, but it is not intended to be a serious implementation.
